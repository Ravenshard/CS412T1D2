Four commands:

roscore
rosluanch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch
rosluanch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_robot.launch
./distance_ahead.py

NOTE:
In order for ./distance_ahead.py to work, you need to change the file to also
be an executable file.  Here's how:
chmod +x distance_ahead.py
chmod +x allows the file to be an executable, which is what the ./ command is

rosrun smach_viewer smach_viewer.py --> run in order to see state machines
